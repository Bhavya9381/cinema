        </div>
        <div class="para">
            <p>Composition in visual arts is the placement or arrangement of visual elements in a work of art. It is how the elements of art—line, shape, color, value, form, texture, and space—are organized or composed according to the principles of art—balance, contrast, emphasis, movement, pattern, rhythm, and unity/variety—and other elements of composition, to give the painting structure and convey the intent of the artist.</p>

            <h2><b>Principles of Composition</b></h2>
            <h4>Balance</h4>
            <p>Balance in art refers to the distribution of the visual weight of objects, colors, texture, and space. If the design was a scale, these elements should be balanced to make a design feel stable.</p>
            <h4>Contrast</h4>
            <p>Contrast is the difference in luminance or color that makes an object (or its representation in an image or display) distinguishable from other objects and the background.</p>
            <h4>Emphasis</h4>
            <p>Emphasis is the part of the design that catches the viewer's attention. Usually, the artist will make one area stand out by contrasting it with other areas.</p>
            <h4>Movement</h4>
            <p>Movement is the path the viewer's eye takes through the artwork, often to focal areas. Such movement can be directed along lines, edges, shapes, and color within the artwork.</p>
            <h4>Pattern</h4>
            <p>Pattern is the repeating of an object or symbol all over the artwork.</p>
            <h4>Rhythm</h4>
            <p>Rhythm is created when one or more elements of design are used repeatedly to create a feeling of organized movement.</p>
            <h4>Unity/Variety</h4>
            <p>Unity is the feeling of harmony between all parts of the artwork creating a sense of completeness. Variety adds interest by using contrasting elements within the composition.</p>

            <h2><b>Elements of Composition</b></h2>
            <h4>Line</h4>
            <p>Lines can be straight or curved, and they can define shapes, contours, and outlines.</p>
            <h4>Shape</h4>
            <p>Shapes are flat, enclosed areas that are two-dimensional (length and height). Artists use both geometric and organic shapes.</p>
            <h4>Color</h4>
            <p>Color is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue (the name of the color), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).</p>
            <h4>Value</h4>
            <p>Value refers to the lightness or darkness of a color. Value is important in creating contrast within an artwork.</p>
            <h4>Form</h4>
            <p>Forms are three-dimensional shapes expressing length, width, and depth. Balls, cylinders, boxes, and pyramids are forms.</p>
            <h4>Texture</h4>
            <p>Texture is the surface quality that can be seen and felt. Textures can be rough or smooth, soft or hard. They do not always feel the way they look; for example, a drawing of a porcupine may look prickly, but if you touch the drawing, the paper is still smooth.</p>
            <h4>Space</h4>
            <p>Space is the area between and around objects. Space can also refer to the feeling of depth. Real space is three-dimensional; in visual art, when we create the feeling or illusion of depth, we call it space.</p>

            <h2>Importance of Composition</h2>
            <p>Good composition is crucial to any work of art. It brings order to the piece, guiding the viewer’s eye and making the work more engaging and dynamic. It can lead the viewer’s eye through the piece, highlighting the focal point, and contributing to the overall message or feeling of the work.</p>

            <h2>Developing Composition Skills</h2>
            <p>Developing strong composition skills takes practice and attention to detail. Study the works of master artists, practice sketching different compositions, and get feedback on your work to improve. Remember that the rules of composition are guidelines, not hard and fast rules, and sometimes the most compelling compositions break them in interesting ways.</p>
